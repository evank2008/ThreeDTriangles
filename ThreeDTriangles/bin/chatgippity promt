suppose im in java and im making a 3d viewing engine to display 3d triangles. I have a Camera object called camera that holds a Point3D position, a Point3D viewTarget which is a unit vector, and an int fov for field of view, and I have an arraylist of Triangle3D objects called triangles. the Triangle3D objects each store an array of Point3D objects of length 3. the Camera class has a method called public void drawTriangle(Graphics g, Triangle3D triangle) which should draw a triangle with no respect to other triangles. how do i cast a triangle's 3d points to a 2d position on screen?
